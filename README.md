### JS Helpers

Express.js Node.js server that allow using frontend js code via API

Js/Ts code is using libraries like Evaluatex.js. 
JSON Data model is use data, that generates by Evaluatex.js.
If we need to work with JSON Data on the server SIDE, 
to exclude data collisions we need to generate the same 
data as generates on the frontend.
